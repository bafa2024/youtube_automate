“A series of medieval winter survival scenes in the style of a 15th-century oil painting, featuring diverse peasants of different ages and genders enduring brutal cold in rural villages. Characters wear layered, ragged wool, burlap, or furs, their faces marked by soot, exhaustion, and frostbite. Settings include mud-and-thatch huts, smoky hearths, straw beds, snowy landscapes, and candle-lit interiors. Scenes show people banking fires, patching walls with dung and moss, sleeping beside livestock, huddling in groups for warmth, eating gruel, and using heated stones for survival. Emotions range from desperation to resilience. Style dark, earthy tones, dramatic lighting, textured brushstrokes, moody realism, medieval atmosphere, ultra-detailed.”
