## Technical Details

### Video Processing Pipeline

1. **File Validation**: Check file formats and sizes
2. **Duration Analysis**: Get video and audio durations
3. **Clip Shuffling**: Randomize B-roll clip order
4. **Concatenation**: Combine all clips using FFmpeg
5. **Duration Sync**: Trim or extend to match voiceover (if enabled)
6. **Audio Overlay**: Mix voiceover with video audio (if enabled)
7. **Final Output**: Generate optimized MP4 file

### Supported Formats

#### Video Input
- **MP4** (.mp4) - Recommended
- **AVI** (.avi)
- **MOV** (.mov)
- **MKV** (.mkv)

#### Audio Input
- **MP3** (.mp3) - Recommended
- **WAV** (.wav)
- **M4A** (.m4a)

#### Output

### Processing Options

#### Duration Synchronization
When "Sync to voiceover length" is enabled:
- The system calculates the total duration of all clips
- If longer than voiceover: clips are trimmed to fit
- If shorter than voiceover: clips are looped or extended
- Ensures perfect synchronization with voiceover

#### Audio Overlay
When "Overlay voiceover" is enabled:
- Voiceover is mixed with any existing video audio
- Audio levels are automatically balanced
- Final audio uses AAC codec for compatibility

## Best Practices

### File Preparation
1. **Use consistent formats**: MP4 for video, MP3 for audio
2. **Optimize file sizes**: Compress large files before upload
3. **Check audio quality**: Ensure voiceover is clear and normalized
4. **Plan your intro**: Keep intro clips short and engaging

### Organization Strategy
1. **Mix clip lengths**: Use varying durations for visual interest
2. **Consider transitions**: Plan how clips will flow together
3. **Test with voiceover**: Upload a test voiceover to check timing
4. **Backup originals**: Keep your source files safe

### Performance Tips
1. **Limit clip count**: 10-20 clips work best for most projects
2. **Use reasonable durations**: 3-10 seconds per clip is ideal
3. **Monitor file sizes**: Large files take longer to process
4. **Check progress**: Use the progress bar to monitor processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Upload Problems
- **File too large**: Compress videos before upload
- **Unsupported format**: Convert to MP4/MOV/AVI/MKV
- **Upload fails**: Check internet connection and try again

#### Processing Issues

- **No audio**: Ensure voiceover file is not corrupted
- **Wrong duration**: Verify voiceover length matches expectations

#### Quality Issues
