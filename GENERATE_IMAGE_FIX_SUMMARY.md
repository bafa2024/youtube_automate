# Generate Image Button - Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **"Failed to read script file" Error**
- **Cause**: The frontend was trying to read script content via an API endpoint that wasn't returning the expected format
- **Fixes**:
  - Changed `/api/files/{file_id}/content` endpoint to return JSON instead of plain text
  - Updated frontend to parse JSON response
  - Added fallback in backend to read script directly if not provided
  - Made `script_text` parameter optional in the generation endpoint

### 2. **"Failed to start generation" Error**
- **Cause**: Missing API key configuration
- **Fixes**:
  - Added `/api/check-api-key` endpoint (was missing)
  - Implemented simple API key storage in `api_key.txt` file
  - Added API key loading on server startup
  - Created API key management endpoints

### 3. **Database Schema Updates**
- Added `result` column to jobs table to store generated image paths
- Added `job_type` column to differentiate between job types
- Created migration script: `add_result_column.py`

### 4. **Image Display Issues**
- Added `/api/files/serve/{file_path:path}` endpoint to serve generated images
- Implemented image preview grid in the UI
- Added proper MIME type detection for served files

## How to Use

### Step 1: Set Your OpenAI API Key
1. Open http://localhost:8080/set_api_key.html in your browser
2. Enter your OpenAI API key (get one from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Click "Save API Key"
4. You should see "API key saved successfully!" message

### Step 2: Use the Generate Image Button
1. Go to the main app at http://localhost:8080/static/index.html
2. Upload a script file (text describing scenes)
3. Upload an audio file (can be any audio file)
4. Configure settings:
   - Number of images (1-20)
   - Image style (Photorealistic, Cinematic, etc.)
   - Character description (optional)
5. Click "Generate AI Images"
6. Monitor progress in the progress bar
7. Generated images will appear in the preview grid

### Alternative: Set API Key via Environment Variable
You can also set the API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
python main.py
```

## Test Files Created
- `test_image_generation_final.html` - Comprehensive test suite
- `debug_file_upload.py` - Debug uploaded files
- `test_backend_direct.py` - Direct backend testing
- `set_api_key.html` - Simple API key setting page

## Key Code Changes

### Backend (main.py)
1. Added `/api/check-api-key` endpoint
2. Modified `/api/settings/api-key` to store key in file
3. Added `/api/files/serve/{file_path:path}` for serving images
4. Updated job response to include `result` field with image paths
5. Added API key loading on startup

### Frontend (app.js)
1. Updated `readScriptFile()` to handle JSON response
2. Enhanced `generateAIImages()` with better error handling
3. Added `displayGeneratedImages()` function
4. Improved job tracking to show generated images

### Database (db_utils.py)
1. Updated `update_job_status()` to accept `result` parameter
2. Modified `create_job()` to include `job_type`

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check server is running**: Make sure the server is running on the correct port (8080)
2. **Check API key**: Verify API key is set by visiting http://localhost:8080/set_api_key.html
3. **Check logs**: Look at the server console for detailed error messages
4. **Check file uploads**: Run `python debug_file_upload.py` to see uploaded files
5. **Test directly**: Run `python test_backend_direct.py` to test the backend directly

The Generate Image button should now work properly!
